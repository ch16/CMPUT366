the tiles in the second tiling will run from 121 to 241 (why?)

(0.1,0.1), will be in the first tile of the first seven tilings, that is, in tiles 0, 121, 242, 363, 484, 605, 726 (why?)

In the eighth tiling  this  point  will  be  in  the  13th  tile  (why?)

which  is  tile  859  (why?)

The largest possible tile index is 967 (why?)


the second and fourthexamples should produce very similar sets of indices (they should have many tiles in common) (why?)
