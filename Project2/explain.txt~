The learned function after only 20 examples only has a few peaks and valleys because each example causes the learnt function to move towards the target function by only a certain percentage (10% in this case). Since there are only 20 examples used so far in the learning process, there are only a limited number of tries for a limited number of coordinates in the input space for which the learning has taken place making the graph of the leanrt function a very incomplete approximation of the target function.


There are 6 peaks and 6 valleys approximately in the learned function.

Around 8 of the peaks and valleys have a very small height which means only one example each was used to approximate those locations. 

The rest are a bit higher which means that multiple examples were within a close distance of each other in those areas which caused the learnt function to move a bit more closer to the target function but they still did not reach it because of the limited number of examples.


If the number of tiles in the x dimenstion are doubled, the width of the valleys and the peaks in the graph in the x dimension will be reduced by half compared to the original width. This is because dividing up the x dimension into the tiles more finely reduces the area generalized during the learning process around the coordinates of the examples.
